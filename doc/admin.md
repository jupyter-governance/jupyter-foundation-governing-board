## Jupyter's Program Manager

The Program Manager is our primary point-of-contact with the Linux Foundation, and is the best person to ask for any questions involving LF processes.
The best way to send messages is via e-mail, please ask another Foundation member if you need it.

Our Program Manager is [Naomi Washington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomiwashington/).

## How to get support from the Linux Foundation

We have a few different avenues for support from the Linux Foundation.

### Use the LF support e-mail

The easiest route is to e-mail `support@jupyterfoundation.org` with your question, and they'll get back to you.
You can also reach out to [our Program Manager](#program-manager), who monitors this e-mail.

### Open a Jira ticket

For technical support within LF, [use this Jira dashboard to open a ticket](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2). You'll need to select the kind of service you need from them, and submit a ticket for them to track.

## How to control the jupyterfoundation.org domain

While most subdomains are controlled by [Jupyter's Cloudflare](xref:jec#cloudflare), the domain `jupyterfoundation.org` is controlled by the Linux Foundation.
If you wish to make modifications to this domain, reach out to [the LF support e-mail](#support).
