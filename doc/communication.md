# Communications

## Foundation board Zulip channel

We have a private Zulip channel in [the Jupyter Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/).
All board members should be added to this channel.
If you are not, ask a member of the Jupyter Executive Council to add you.

## All foundation member Zulip channel

This channel in Zulip is for all representatives of the foundation to communicate with one another:

[#foundation-members](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/550209-foundation-members)

There's also a user group called `foundation-members`.

### To add foundation members to the channel

1. Add them to the `foundation-members` google group.
2. Add them to the `#foundation-members` channel.
