### Introduction
Rus Pandey called the meeting to order at 8:05 AM Pacific Daylight Time and Naomi Washington recorded the minutes. A quorum of Governing Board Members was established for the conduct of business, and the meeting, having been duly convened, was ready to proceed with business.
Washington reminded the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy Notice to which all meetings must adhere.

### PMO SoW Expansion
Ana Ruvalcaba informed the governing board that certain board members met with George Peden to discuss the current PMO Statement of Work (SoW) and potential expansions. Proposed additions included trademark enforcement and the Jupyter community calls. Governing board members were asked to suggest further additions before the PMO lead provides an updated SoW. It was also recommended that a quarterly PMO review be conducted.

Discussion ensued around the Jupyter Community Call, described as a "mini JupyterCon," which serves as a platform for community-led sharing of Jupyter activities. While the calendar is on Jupyter.org, its visibility might need improvement. Discussions covered ownership of aspects of the community call and balancing community involvement. It was clarified that the PMO would handle logistics and organization, not facilitation. 

Governing board members were asked to review the SoW and submit any additional scopes of work by Monday, with Washington sending a final notice by Monday EOD.

### JupyterCon 2026
Rick Wagner led the discussion on JupyterCon 2026 planning. A decision regarding announcing JupyterCon 2026 during this year's event needs to be made within two weeks. It was noted that 2025 attendance estimates might be too high and should be reevaluated. Site selection can commence without immediate budget commitments, as funding obligations will depend on the chosen venue. More affordable US locations like Phoenix or Scottsdale, Arizona, were suggested. The primary decision is whether to host the event in the US or Europe. Deb Giles may be given three potential sites (two in the US and one in Europe) to consider.

The timing for the event will prioritize Fall, with late October/early November decided upon. Target attendance is 450-500, and regions for consideration were discussed. It was clarified that venue choice is a key factor in event affordability. 

Savannah Ostrowski left the meeting at 10:45. 

A small booth or table for the Executive Council (EC) at JupyterCon was also discussed.

### Structure Collaboration
Rus Pandey initiated a discussion about pairing Executive Council (EC) members with Governing Board (GB) members to foster collaboration and address existing gaps. He suggested potentially allocating a small amount of funds to support these interactions, for instance, for activities like group lunches.

Action Items:
- Washington to add this to the next agenda. 
- Rus Pandey to create a parent sheet to pair people up.

### Budget Priority Visibility
The governing board had identified the need for money allocations to be visible to the community and are identifying the best way to showcase how the funds will be used to address community concerns and priorities.

### Closing
Rus Pandey thanked the attendees for their time and participation, called the meeting to a close, and the meeting of the Governing Board adjourned at 9:03 AM Pacific Daylight Time.

### Notes

* Program management: discussed proposal from LF about a program manager resource to start in March.  
  * The current scope of responsibilities planned is:  
    * Coordinate deck creation with ED, Chairperson, other stakeholders  
    * Distribute materials, take minutes, follow up on action items, attendance, etc.  
    * Support strategic discussions and planning  
    * Manage permissions / access to Zoom  
    * Event coordination for events (ONLY booth sponsorships, project webinars / meetups)  
    * Respond to membership inquiries  
    * Facilitate new member onboarding (via email)  
    * Advising Executive Director / Board chair  
  * The governing board will discuss offline whether additional initial responsibilities should be added.  
* Discussed allocating and prioritizing areas of funding, and especially how to get community input.  
  * Some ideas for getting community input included:  
    * Having subprojects or groups from Jupyter present 5-minute talks to the governing board about their needs  
    * Starting an online conversation, with some structure, about needs of subprojects  
    * Designing and opening a call for proposals for funding, with a formal application process  
  * This conversation included some side discussion of how much of the in-process governing board discussions should be private to the governing board vs public. No definite conclusion reached on this topic, but sentiment was expressed to have clear communication with the public about discussions (though perhaps after the fact) to build trust with the community.  
* LF Member summit governing board meeting: some discussion around funding governing board members to attend the in-person meeting at the LF Member summit in March. The governing board had already approved some funding for attendance. We will gather information this week about how much we might need for the upcoming meeting and propose a budget request next time if we exceed the pre-existing allocation.  
* General member governing board representative: a very short discussion introducing the topic of selecting a general member representative to the governing board. We will start an offline discussion to continue the conversation.

### Notes

* Discussed how to support the Jupyter community, how do we improve the health and capacity of the Jupyter subprojects.

### Notes

* Introduce new EC members (Chris Holdgraf and Rick Wagner). We then had a short discussion about how EC elections work, how EC term limits work, and the 2025 election.  
* Budget discussion: approved a $20/month Figma subscription charge to the Jupyter Foundation budget  
* Discussed how to track governing board work asynchronously. We decided to create a public and private repos under the [github.com/jupyter-governance](http://github.com/jupyter-governance) org, along with an associated GitHub project tracking board, to track both public and private business of the Jupyter Foundation Governing Board. This mirrors the system the EC has been using recently.  
* Briefly discussed the upcoming JupyterCon and asked if anyone would like to help with reviewing proposals at a future date, etc.  
* Discussed asking for program management support for Jupyter Foundation and EC meetings (\~10 meetings/month currently), including note taking, scheduling meetings, and putting together an agenda. Scott Nicholas from LF will get a quote for these services.  
* Discussed an in-person governing board meeting at the LF Member Summit in March. Decided to pursue scheduling a meeting Monday, March 17\.  
* Very brief introduction to a discussion about the areas in which we could invest Jupyter Foundation funds that would benefit the community the most, and how to work with the community to decide these strategic areas. We decided to start an asynchronous discussion on this topic and continue this discussion next meeting.
