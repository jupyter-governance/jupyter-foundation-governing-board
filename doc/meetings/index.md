# Meetings and minutes

## Where to find the meeting minutes

The [Board Google Drive](#google-drive) contains the minutes of each of our meetings.
You can find it in the folder: {kbd}`Governing Board` -> {kbd}`Board Meeting Minutes`.

After each meeting we also approve _public_ meeting minutes and post them in this section of the team compass.

## How we approve meeting minutes

After each meeting, here's how we approve meeting minutes.

- Our [Program Manager](#role:program-manager) will finalize the meeting minutes.
- Each board member will get an e-mail noting that the minutes are ready for review.
- Each board member reviews the minutes, and votes to approve them [via the LF OpenDev portal](#lf-dashboard).
