# Meetings and minutes

## Where to find the meeting minutes

The [Board Google Drive](#google-drive) contains the minutes of each of our meetings.
You can find it in the folder: {kbd}`Governing Board` -> {kbd}`Board Meeting Minutes`.

After each meeting we also approve _public_ meeting minutes and post them in this section of the team compass.

## How we approve meeting minutes

We follow a ["lazy consensus" model](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html#lazy-consensus) for meeting minutes. Here's an overview of the process:

- **Draft**: Draft minutes are circulated by the [](#role:program-manager) 1 week after each board meeting.
- **Review**: Board members have at least 1 week to review and propose changes. Approve them [via the LF OpenDev portal](#lf-dashboard).
- **Approval without changes**: If no changes are suggested during the initial review, the minutes will be automatically approved.
- **Changes are proposed**: The Review period will extend by 1 week.

## Public meeting minutes

After each board meeting, the [](#role:program-manager) prepares a version of the minutes meant for release to the public.
They propose this as a Pull Request to the Foundation Board team compass. Any board member is encouraged to merge it.
