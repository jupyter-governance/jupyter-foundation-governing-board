# Meetings and minutes

## Where to find the meeting minutes

We use Google Docs to track the minutes of each of our meetings.
[You can find a folder with the board's meeting minutes here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/19rZh51cFav9cMY6GbQx3i36QbQfsWtn4).

After each meeting we also approve _public_ meeting minutes and post them in this section of the team compass.
