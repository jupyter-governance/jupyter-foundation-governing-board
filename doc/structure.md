# Team structure

The Jupyter Foundation structure is defined [here in the Jupyter governance documentation](https://jupyter.org/governance/jupyter_foundation.html#membership).

In addition, there are a few specific roles and groups defined within the Jupyter Foundation and its Governing Board, described below.

## Board Chair

The Board Chair leads the Jupyter Foundation Governing Board ("Board") in conducting discussion and decisions that accomplish the Board's goals. Below are the responsibilities for this role:

(role:treasurer)=
### Current Board Treasurer

(subcommittees)=
## Subcommittees

A subcommittee is an ongoing working group of Board members that focuses on a thematic area over time. They were initially formed around [the Foundation's goals and strategy](./strategy.md).

### What is the purpose of subcommittees?

The primary goals of subcommittees are to:

- Make proposals to the Foundation Board that accomplish the goals in their thematic area.
- Oversee the implementation of funds according to proposals that have been accepted, where applicable.

### How do we determine membership of subcommittees?

By default, subcommittees are only open to Foundation Board members. However, subcommittees may elect to open their membership to all Foundation members.

If a subcommittee has members that are not also on the Board, then any decisions around funding must be made with a majority vote of the Board members on the subcommittee.

### List of subcommittees

This is still a work in progress. The Board has initially defined the following subcommittees:

- **Technical Support Committee** - dedicated to improving the quality, reliability, and safety of Project Jupyter's software.
- **Community Support Committee** - dedicated to improving the health of Project Jupyter's contributor community.
- **Foundation Membership Development Committee** - dedicated to ensuring that the Jupyter Foundation membership grows and benefits from the Foundation.
