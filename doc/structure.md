# Team structure

The Jupyter Foundation structure is defined [here in the Jupyter governance documentation](https://jupyter.org/governance/jupyter_foundation.html#membership).

In addition, there are a few specific roles and groups defined within the Jupyter Foundation and its Governing Board, described below.

### Current Board Treasurer

(subcommittees)=
## Subcommittees

A subcommittee is an ongoing working group of Board members that focuses on a thematic area over time. They were initially formed around [the Foundation's goals and strategy](./strategy.md).

### What is the purpose of subcommittees?

The primary goals of subcommittees are to:

- Make proposals to the Foundation Board that accomplish the goals in their thematic area.
- Oversee the implementation of funds according to proposals that have been accepted, where applicable.

### How do we determine membership of subcommittees?

By default, subcommittees are only open to Foundation Board members. However, subcommittees may elect to open their membership to all Foundation members.

If a subcommittee has members that are not also on the Board, then any decisions around funding must be made with a majority vote of the Board members on the subcommittee.

### Policies and Procedures

#### Membership

1. [Per the charter](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/jupyter-foundation.pdf) (2.b.) Premier Members will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and any committee. 
2. Members of the Governing Board are entitled to serve on committees as voting members.
3. The GB can appoint non-member specialists to a committee in special cases. Such special cases should be recorded in the formation GB resolution. These specialists will act as subject matter experts, but may not have voting rights except as defined in the charter (currently limited to premier members).
4. Premier members can have more than one representative of the company attend committee meetings, but only one will be a voting member.

#### Meetings

1. The Committee determines the frequency of meetings to get their work done. 
2. A closed meeting includes only voting members of the committee. An example of why a committee may choose a closed meeting is if a confidential situation arises (e.g., a Code of Conduct report).
3. Committee meeting attendees will be recorded, as well as any decisions, recommendations, and reports from the committee to the GB.
4. All committee artifacts (e.g., minutes, reports, etc.) will be available to any GB member, unless explicitly kept private due to the sensitive nature of the work (e.g., artifacts pertaining to a code of conduct discussion).
5. While minutes covering attendance and decisions should be recorded, minutes of a Committee need not be approved by the Committee.

#### Committee Officers

1. The committee elects a chairperson. The committee can elect co-chairs or vice-chairs as they see fit. These roles are collectively known as the committee officers.
2. Officers must be voting members of the committee.
3. Elected positions serve for a year or until their successors are elected. A committee member serving in a position can be re-elected in subsequent years.
4. LF staff run the election (gathering candidate nominations, running the ballot, announcing and recording the outcome) in a reasonable manner.
5. The chairperson is responsible for:  
    a. Calling the meeting, setting and publishing the agenda before the meeting, and running the meeting.  
    b. Identify messaging that flows to the GB, Members, and public community in both inclusive and exclusive manners as necessary.   
    c. The chairperson is responsible for providing regular status updates to the GB.  
    d. Other responsibilities can involve:   
    - driving proposal review, working with EC members to identify problems in the community, identifying SMEs and key contacts to facilitate community movement, and liaising between the board and the committees.
