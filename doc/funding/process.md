# Process for funding proposals

This describes the process that the board and the Jupyter community follow in order to unlock funds from the Foundation.

Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year, with funds being released according to our [budget allocations](./budget.md). 

## Important links

- [`jupyter-governance/funding-proposals`](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals) is the repository where we track proposals.
- [This issue template](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals/issues/new?template=proposal.md) begins a new proposal idea, we use it to coordinate writing, discussion, and status.
- **[This proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/101cNUZbGCWUMn8LbDiSRjL5Q78e_31gN4-FqCiSp47o/edit?usp=drive_link)** has all the information needed for a new proposal. Authors duplicate it to do their writing in a public space.
- **[This proposals tracker Board](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-governance/projects/13)** is where all proposals are tracked - update the "status" field as you write.

## Overview of the process

1. **Discussion**: Create an issue to track discussion and status around the proposal.

   - [Issue template for new proposals →](https://github.com/jupyter-governance/funding-proposals/issues/new?template=proposal.md)
   - [Board for tracking all proposals →](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-governance/projects/13)
1. **Writing**: When the idea is concrete-enough, draft language for the proposal.
   - Create a [new proposal document from this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/101cNUZbGCWUMn8LbDiSRjL5Q78e_31gN4-FqCiSp47o/edit?usp=sharing).
   - Put it in the same folder as the template so anyone can access.
   - Set the issue status to {kbd}`Writing`.
   - See [](#tips-for-writing-a-proposal).
1. **Submission**: When the proposal is ready for review, announce that it's ready for a subcommittee to take a look.
   - Ping the [`@jupyter-foundation-governing-board` team](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-governance/teams/jupyter-foundation-governing-board) in a comment.
   - Set the status to {kbd}`Review`.
1. **Review**: Subcommittees review proposals and recommend next actions.
   - Read [](#timing-goals).
   - A few potential outcomes from the review process:
      - **Recommend for funding**.
      - **Request changes**.
      - **Reject** (for low-quality or submissions not aligned with [our funding priorities](priorities.md)).
1. **Board Review**: At least one week is given to the Foundation Board to request actions other than approval.
   - If there are no objections after one week, then the funding is approved.
   - If there are objections or requested changes, the subcommittee decides how to proceed.
1. **Sign-Off by LF**: The [Treasurer](#role:treasurer) coordinates with the [LF Program Manager](#role:program-manager) and Accountant for financial validation and compliance.
1. **Execution**: Once approved, funds are disbursed by LF (the specific mechanism and timing will depend on the proposal). Proposal owners are responsible for ensuring the work is executed.
1. **Reporting**. Proposal owners should provide regular updates to the Foundation board, ideally in the form of public blog posts. At least one public blog post should be communicated describing the outcomes of the funding effort.

## Exepectations and goals for timing

To begin, our focus is on learning how to follow this process and work out the kinks. 
**This is still a work in progress**! We aim to strike a balance between reviewing frequently, and reviewing on a reliable timeframe that helps us consider many proposals at once without too much toil. We're still working on the right balance, so bear with us!

Here's a rough summary of dates we aim to hit.

| Date | Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Aug 26** | Communicate this process to the board. |
| **Aug 29** | CFP (Call for Proposals) sent out. |
| **2 weeks from CFP** | Proposal issue discussion. |
| **2 weeks from issue discussion** | Proposal drafting. |
| **Sep 28** | Submission deadline. Proposals are snapshotted as a PDF and sent to the relevant committee. |
| **Oct 10** | Committee review (2 weeks after submission deadline). |
| **Oct 17** | Board review (asynchronous, 1 week after committee submits to board). |
| **Oct 20** | Announce funded proposals. |

Again, **this is an experiment** - our goal is to try this process out and to learn, not to get it perfect. Please be patient and give feedback about how we can improve.

## Tips for writing a proposal

- Focus on the outcomes and the value to the community, not implementation details.
- Focus on our [funding priorities](priorities.md) and [board strategy](../strategy.md).
- The smaller the budget you're proposing, the higher chance it will be accepted.
- The more support you can show from the community, the higher chance it will be accepted.

## Who can propose funding?

Anybody can propose funding following the process above, and we encourage community members to do so as collaborative efforts.
