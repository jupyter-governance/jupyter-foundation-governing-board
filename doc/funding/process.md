# Process for funding proposals

This describes the process that the board and the Jupyter community follow in order to unlock funds from the Foundation.

Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year, with funds being released according to our [budget allocations](./budget.md). 

## Step by step overview

1. **Proposer creates an issue on GitHub**: This issue gets added to a Proposals Project Board in a “Drafting” state. This is for scoping the big idea and getting others on board.

   :::{warning} TODO
   - Link to proposals project board
   - Link to draft issue link.
   :::
2. **Proposer creates a thread on Discourse**: This is for feedback and discussion around the proposal, linked from the issue.
   :::{warning} TODO
   - Link to the sub-category in Discourse
   - Link to open a Discourse thread directly?
   :::
3. **Proposer starts drafting**: When the idea is concrete-enough, the proposer drafts language for the proposal. Use [the Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/101cNUZbGCWUMn8LbDiSRjL5Q78e_31gN4-FqCiSp47o/edit?tab=t.5inaorn0ect5#heading=h.5i77we14fyb) and link it to the GitHub issue.
4. **Submit Proposal**: Submit the proposal for review by a subcommittee by `???` (marking a github status? changing the proposal metadata in a google doc?)

   :::{warning} TODO
   - Link to proposals project board
   - Link to draft issue link.
   :::
5. **Subcommittee Review**: Subcommittees review proposals and recommend next actions.[^expectations] The GitHub issue is moved to “In Review” in the Project Board. Here are a few potential outcomes from the review process:
   - Recommend the proposal for board vote
   - Request revisions from the proposer
   - Reject low-quality or misaligned submissions without a general board vote.

  [^expectations]: Subcommittees should nominate proposals at least two weeks ahead of the second general board meeting of the month. If the subcommittee does not provide feedback within the review window, the proposal may still proceed to board vote at the discretion of the Treasurer and Board Chair to avoid unnecessary delays.
6. **Board Review and Vote**: All subcommittee-nominated proposals are reviewed and voted on during the second board meeting of each month. Here are potential outcomes from the board:
   - **Accept**: Funds are approved by the board and move to approval by LF.
   - **Reject**: Funds are not approved and the process ends for this proposal.
   - **Request revisions**: Funds are not approved, with an invitation to re-submit via the subcommittee.
7. **Sign-Off by LF Team**: The [Treasurer](#role:treasurer) coordinates with the [LF Program Manager](#role:program-manager) and Accountant for financial validation and compliance.
   :::{warning} TODO
   - How is this formally encoded? Is there a status or documentation somewhere to note when this has been done?
   :::
8. **Execution and Reporting**: Once approved, funds are disbursed by LF (the specific mechanism and timing will depend on the proposal). Proposal owners execute the work and provide a brief report on fund usage (quarterly or upon completion).

### Example schedule

To illustrate how this cadence works in practice. Let’s consider example schedules for August and September.  

| Subcommittee nomination deadline (2 weeks from board vote) | Board vote (2nd board meeting of the month) | Disbursement (Target) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Friday August 8th | Friday August 22nd  | September 1st  |
| Friday September 5th | Friday September 19th | October 1st  |

:::{note}
While the board is preparing to vote on one batch of proposals (e.g., for the September 19th meeting), subcommittees should already be reviewing and nominating the **next batch of proposals** for the following month’s meeting. This rolling cadence ensures there is no downtime between proposal cycles and keeps momentum across quarters.

## How to create a proposal

We will track proposals in the queue and their status on GitHub (i.e., we will use GitHub for project management). Actual proposals will be drafted in Google Docs and will use a proposal template for ease of review. On GitHub, each ticket should have:

:::{note} The annual proposal cycle ends in September
This ensures that all approved proposals have sufficient time to execute and report before the end of the fiscal year, giving proposers a full quarter to utilize the funds.

## Who can propose funding?

Anybody can propose funding following the process above, and we encourage community members to do so as collaborative efforts.
