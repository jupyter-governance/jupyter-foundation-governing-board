# Process for funding

This is the process the Board currently follows, and it will improve the details of this process as we begin taking our first steps.

- The [Board Chair](#board-chair) is accountable for ensuring the Board understands its budget.
- [Subcommittees](#subcommittees) (or individual board members) make proposals for funding to the Board.
- The Board takes a vote on whether to fund each proposal.
- If proposals are accepted, the Board will delegate the implementation of the proposal to a subcommittee or individual on the Board.
- If subcommittees are responsible for implementing a proposal, then a **majority vote of the Governing Board members on the subcommittee** makes decision about how to spend the funds, as long as it is under the total amount in the proposal.   

## How to submit a proposal for funding

- Duplicate it into a new document (it should be placed in the `Funding Proposals` folder in the Board's Google Drive).
- Follow the instructions in the template.
