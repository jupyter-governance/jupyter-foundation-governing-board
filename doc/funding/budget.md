# Budget allocations

This page describes the current % allocations of our budget.
See @priorities for more information about the goals and outcomes this budget is meant to support.

Budget allocations are distributed in 2 phases:

- Half 1 (H1, January - June)
- Half 2 (H2, July - December)

Any unspent funds remaining at the end of the half will be returned to the general pool for mid-year reallocation.

Amendments to budget allocations may be approved with a vote from the board, with input from the [Treasurer](#role:treasurer) and [Board Chair](#role:chair), and financial validation from the [LF Program Manager](#role:program-manager) and Accountant.
