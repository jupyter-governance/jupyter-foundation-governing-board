# The Jupyter Foundation Board Team Compass

This is the Team Compass for the Board of the [Jupyter Foundation](https://jupyterfoundation.org). It is the source of truth for the group's plans, practices, and policies. It is also a place where we share notes and updates from our work.

:::{note} Work in progress
This Team Compass is very young and still a work in progress. It is likely missing many things, and contributions are welcome!
