# About the foundation

## The Jupyter Foundation Charter

The [Jupyter Foundation page in the governance documentation](https://jupyter.org/governance/jupyter_foundation.html) defines the Foundation's charter and overall structure.

## Our Mission

The Jupyter Foundation exists to ensure that Project Jupyter has the resources it needs to build sustainable, reliable, and impactful technology.

## What is the Foundation’s problem to solve?

As Jupyter has grown its impact, it has had an increasing lack of resources needed to drive the project forward. This creates risk for both the Jupyter maintainers (who feel an increasing burden to deliver impactful software to a growing user base) as well as for the members of the Jupyter Foundation (who depend on Jupyter being a reliable and innovating technology organization).

A major source of stress is the *lack of financial resources* needed to ensure Jupyter can sustainably meet its own goals and the goals of the Foundation’s member organizations. Many companies desire to support Jupyter with financial resources, staff that are interested in contributing, and unique perspectives that can help Jupyter build tools that are more impactful. 

However, Jupyter’s community is often opaque and has many different stakeholders and needs. Its community is often skeptical of “top-down” signals or requests. **The Foundation is an opportunity to provide financial and strategic resources that help Project Jupyter be more reliable and effective for all of its stakeholders. To do so effectively, the Foundation must deliver clear value to both the Jupyter community and to the Foundation member communities.**
